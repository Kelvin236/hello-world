# hello-world
This repository serves as an introduction to using Github. 

Hey y'all!

I'm Kelvin. I got GitHub to make my programming endeavours easier.
Last year I began using Django for an internship and since then I have been trying to learn more
about web development. I am currently learning React.js.
